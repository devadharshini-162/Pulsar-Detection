# Pulsar-Detection
Detecting pulsars using Machine learning techniques like LSTM, Attention layers and CNN
This project contains a synthetic dataset alongside with the HTRU2 dataset. The HTRU2 dataset is imbalanced and so that I have generated synthetic dataset to increase the minority class (detected pulsars).
I have also utilised SMOTE for maintaing class imbalance. I have used GAN for generating the synthetuc dataset
